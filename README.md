# ABHIGRAHA 2K25 â€” Freshers Event Portal

A fullâ€‘stack event management and discovery portal for ABHIGRAHA 2K25. This repository contains the frontend and supporting assets, along with documentation for the backend APIs, infrastructure, and deployment workflows.

Live demo: TO_BE_ADDED â€¢ Status: Active development â€¢ License: MIT

## Overview

ABHIGRAHA 2K25 is a campusâ€‘wide fresherâ€™s festival. The portal streamlines:
- Public pages: home, events catalog, schedule, gallery, sponsors, team, contact
- User flows: sign up/sign in, profile, event registration, RSVP, reminders
- Organizer flows: event CRUD, schedule builder, attendee export, announcements
- Admin flows: role management, content moderation, analytics snapshots

Why this stack? We prioritized developer velocity, low operational overhead, and the ability to iterate on content and features quickly as the festival timeline evolves.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Vite, React Router, TailwindCSS (or CSS Modules), TanStack Query
- Backend: Node.js, Express (or Fastify), JWT auth, Zod validation
- Database: PostgreSQL (Railway â†’ Render/Supabase migration)
- ORM/Schema: Prisma or Drizzle (choose one); migrations tracked in repo
- Storage: Dropbox App Folder for media with shortâ€‘lived signed URLs
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend). Supabase optional for managed Postgres and auth/storage alternatives
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for type check, lint, build, and preview deployments

---

## Infrastructure and Deployment Story

We evolved infra pragmatically through the festival cycle:

1) Phase 1 â€” Bootstrap on Railway + PostgreSQL
- Goal: move fast with a singleâ€‘click Postgres and Node service
- Outcome: rapid prototyping, but hit freeâ€‘tier sleep limits and regional constraints

2) Phase 2 â€” Backend to Render, DB to Managed Postgres
- Reason: alwaysâ€‘on services, better autoscaling, predictable pricing
- Options: Render PostgreSQL or external DB
- Decision: API on Render; DB on Supabase or Render Postgres depending on team preference

3) Phase 3 â€” Object Storage via Dropbox
- Simpler than S3 for a small team; App Folder with scoped access
- Files uploaded serverâ€‘side; public access via shortâ€‘lived signed links generated by backend

4) Phase 4 â€” Frontend on Vercel
- Fast static hosting + edge network, preview deployments per PR
- Environment variables configured per environment (Preview/Production)

5) Observability & Ops
- Logs: Render dashboard + Vercel logs
- Metrics: minimal, with API request logs and error reporting (Sentry optional)
- Backups: Supabase automated backups; periodic dump for Render Postgres

Environment Variables (representative)
- FRONTEND
  - VITE_API_BASE_URL
  - VITE_PUBLIC_SITE_URL
- BACKEND
  - DATABASE_URL (Postgres connection)
  - JWT_SECRET
  - DROPBOX_APP_KEY, DROPBOX_APP_SECRET, DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN
  - CORS_ORIGIN (commaâ€‘separated)

## Local Development Setup

Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PNPM (recommended) or npm/yarn
- PostgreSQL 14+ (local or cloud) or Supabase project
- Dropbox App (scoped to App Folder) for media

Steps
1) Clone
   - git clone https://github.com/arpanpramanik2003/freshers-website
   - cd freshers-website
2) Install deps
   - pnpm install
3) Configure envs
   - cp .env.example .env (root and server/.env, apps/web/.env as needed)
   - Fill values for DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, VITE_API_BASE_URL, Dropbox creds
4) Database
   - Run migrations: pnpm -C server prisma migrate dev  (or drizzle kit)
   - Seed (optional): pnpm -C server seed
5) Start dev
   - Frontend: pnpm -C apps/web dev
   - Backend: pnpm -C server dev
6) Open
   - http://localhost:5173 (frontend)
   - http://localhost:3000 (backend)
